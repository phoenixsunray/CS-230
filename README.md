# CS 230 Project 2 – Software Design Reflection
# Eriik Snyder

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements
The client was **The Gaming Room**, a company with an Android-based game called *Draw It or Lose It*. They wanted to expand this game into a **web-based application** that could run across multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. The main requirement was to design a scalable, secure, and responsive application capable of supporting thousands of concurrent users while remaining compatible with various browsers and operating systems.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did particularly well in **evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each platform**. My analysis clearly outlined server-side, client-side, and development tool considerations, which provided the client with a practical comparison of their options. My **recommendations section** was especially strong, as it gave a clear path forward using Linux-based deployment and modern web development practices.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document forced me to think carefully about **constraints, scalability, and security before coding**. This helped me avoid making assumptions and ensured I was considering the bigger picture, not just writing code that worked in isolation. It created a **roadmap** that connected the client’s needs to the technical implementation.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I would expand on the **system architecture view**. While it wasn’t required for this project, adding diagrams or logical topologies of how the servers, clients, and storage interact would make the document more complete and professional. Visual representations could also help non-technical stakeholders understand the proposed solution better.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on **scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and secure gameplay**. For example, the choice to recommend Linux servers and RESTful APIs came from understanding the client’s need for cost efficiency, reliability, and accessibility across devices. Considering user needs is vital because a design that ignores them may technically function but **fail to satisfy the client or end users**, ultimately making the product unsuccessful.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design with a **structured process**—starting with requirements gathering, then evaluating constraints, analyzing platforms, and finally recommending the best solution. In the future, I would continue using this systematic approach while also incorporating **more diagrams and user stories** to bridge the gap between technical details and real-world usage. I’d also apply **iterative design**, reviewing sections earlier in the process to catch gaps before they grow larger.
